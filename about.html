<P style="background-color:Tomato;"> In the car cinema utilises state of the art cinema equipment, combining the highest definition outdoor LED screens and high-grade digital projectors offering full HD picture quality with an incredible wireless transmission of sound straight into the vehicle, to produce an exceptional cinematic experience. 

Our incredible in-car speaker solution means there’s no need to tune your car radio and risk running the battery flat. Instead, each guest is given a speaker box on arrival that sits on your dashboard (and is sanitised between screenings), that relays full frequency wireless sound directly into the car. It’s battery-powered and even has a touch screen on the front that lets you read about the film, see information on our partners and even check what food and drink is available and where the toilet facilities are located. We think this is the technology that really brings the Drive-In experience into the 21st century and we know you’ll love it!<p1/>

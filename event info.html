  <P style="background-color:Tomato;">BOOKING YOUR TICKETS  

    <P>Please take note of the film certification when purchasing tickets. The film certification is strictly enforced at the ticket checkpoint. ID will be required for those patrons who are lucky enough to look younger than the age of the film certification. 
    
    Parking spaces will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.</P>
    
      
    
   <P style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);"> PARKING</P>  
    
   <P>Please ensure you follow the parking team’s directions and only move when directed. The site will be clearly marked out.</P>  
    
   <P>Once parked you will not be able to leave your allocated bay until the end of the event. No vehicles are authorised to move throughout the site whilst the event is open. As with entrance, please ensure you follow instructions from our parking team during exit from the event, & do not overtake other cars. This will ensure all audience members can leave in the shortest time possible.</P>   
    
    <P>Please ensure any lights (including daytime running lights) are switched off once you park in your allocated bay. Remember to switch your lights back on before moving at the end of the event (for evening screenings).</P>  
    
    <P style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);">ENTRY TO SITE </P>
    
   <P> You must provide your Registration Number for the car you are going to attend the event in. This will be used onsite to identify your booking. If your number plate has changed since you booked your ticket, you can amend it free of charge by emailing info@thelunacinema.com. You will need to amend this at least an hour and a half before the screening to make sure our recognition software is updated in time.</P>
    
   <P> Upon arrival at the event, your vehicle number plate will be scanned and your booking will be verified. Remember to stop at the speaker collection point before entering the arena. This will also be the collection point for any pre-ordered hampers.</P>  
    
   <P>In the interests of protecting the environment, please make sure you have your engines turned off during the film. Remember it may get cold so please bring warm clothing/blankets with you. Drivers side windows can be open.</P>
    
    <P>Smoking is not permitted at this event, this includes e-cigarettes.</P>
    
    <P style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);">FOOD & DRINK</P> 
    
   <P>You can order food & drink once onsite and parked. Scan the QR code on the front of the speaker to be taken to our menu. Once ordered you will receive a text message when your food is ready to collect. We ask that guests wear a facemask when going to collect their food. If you have any issues with your order, please contact the WhatsApp number (this is displayed on the front of the speaker). Please note no cash payments can be accepted on site.</P>
    
    <P>Any alcoholic drinks purchased on site must be consumed before leaving the site.</P>

    <P style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);">TOILETS</P>

Please make sure you maintain your distance from other customers. Hand sanitiser stations will be positioned outside the toilets (as well as inside) so please sanitise hands both before and after entering. The toilets are regularly cleaned and inspected.</P>  
    
   <P style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);"> MEDICS / ASSISTANCE</P> 
    
    <p>Other than using the toilet and collecting hot food orders you will not need to leave your vehicle. If you require assistance or have any questions, please contact the WhatsApp number displayed on the front of the speaker.</p>
    
   <P> We have medics onsite – if you require medical assistance, please contact the WhatsApp number displayed on the front of the speaker unit.</P>  
    
    <p>Information will be displayed on screen and via audio announcements on your speaker. Please look/listen out for these.</p>  
    
    <p style="background-color:rgb(151, 20, 238);">LEAVING THE EVENT</p>
    
    <P>At the end of the event, you will pass a speaker drop-off point similar to the collection point you passed on the way in. Please follow the directions of the parking team and stop to place your speaker on the table. Please treat the speakers with respect and place them gently! We need them to bring the Drive-in experience to others!</P>
